    <h2>Summary of me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I’m Dhanush K a first-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student passionate about <br>
        creating solutions that blend tech with life. I'm on a journey to build something meaningful, and I’m <br>
        working towards launching my own SaaS startup by early 2025. <br> <br>

        Lately, I’ve taken a step back, rethinking some connections and focusing on my growth. <br>
        Sometimes, we hold onto feelings that shape us in unexpected ways, even if they stay unspoken. <br>
        As I keep learning and building, I want to create something valuable, not just for me but for those <br>
        who've truly touched my heart.
